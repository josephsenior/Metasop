      "risk": "Exchange API Rate Limiting (IP Ban from Binance/Coinbase). by proxying too many user requests from a single server IP, the platform could be banned by exchanges, halting all trading for all users. High Impact, Medium Probability. Mitigation: Implement strict internal rate limiting per user. Use a pool of rotating proxy IPs for the backend if volume scales significantly. Implement exponential backoff in the CCXT adapter wrapper. Verification: Load test with mocked rate-limit headers to ensure backoff logic triggers correctly. Monitor 'X-MBX-USED-WEIGHT' headers from Binance in production logs. Coverage: 85% branch coverage on the 'ExchangeAdapter' module to ensure all error handling paths (429, 5xx) are tested. Performance Metrics: P95 API Response Time: < 200ms. Database Query Time: < 50ms (for hot path). Page Load Time: < 1.5s. Time to Interactive: < 2.0s. Summary: The QA strategy for TradePulse focuses on the reliability and speed of the 'Layer 2' trading experience. Given the financial nature of the application, testing prioritizes the accuracy of portfolio calculations and the security of API credential storage. A hybrid approach using Jest for logic and Playwright for E2E flows ensures that both the backend math and the frontend execution work seamlessly. Special attention is paid to mocking external exchange interactions to prevent flakiness and avoid rate limits during CI runs. Description: This Quality Assurance Plan adopts a 'Risk-Based Testing' methodology. We identify the highest risk areas—specifically Order Execution and API Key Security—and allocate the densest test coverage there. \n\n**Testing Layers:**\n1. **Unit Tests**: Focused on the `PortfolioService` (math accuracy) and `EncryptionService` (security). We use Jest for Node.js and Pytest for the Python AI worker.\n2. **Integration Tests**: Focused on the `ExchangeAdapter` (CCXT wrapper). We use Testcontainers to spin up a real Redis instance to verify the Pub/Sub flow for market data updates.\n3. **E2E Tests**: Focused on the 'Happy Path' of a trader: Login -> Connect -> Trade. These run against a Staging environment connected to Exchange Testnets (Sandbox).\n\n**Performance & Security:**\nPerformance tests using k6 will simulate high-frequency price updates to ensure the WebSocket gateway doesn't choke. Security testing includes automated dependency scanning and specific tests to verify that the database never holds plain-text API secrets.

Performance Metrics: api_response_time_p95: 200ms, database_query_time: 50ms, first_contentful_paint: 1.0s, largest_contentful_paint: 2.5s, page_load_time: 1.5s, recommendations: ['Implement Redis caching for Portfolio Summary endpoints.', 'Use WebSocket compression (permessage-deflate) to reduce bandwidth.', 'Lazy load the TradingView chart library to improve FCP.'], time_to_interactive: 2.0s. Risk Analysis: Impact: High, Mitigation: Implement strict internal rate limiting per user. Use a pool of rotating proxy IPs for the backend if volume scales significantly. Implement exponential backoff in the CCXT adapter wrapper., Risk: Exchange API Rate Limiting (IP Ban). Impact: High, Mitigation: Use 'Sandbox' keys for E2E tests. Mock CCXT responses for Integration tests. Never use real funds for automated testing., Risk: Financial Loss during Automated Testing. Impact: Medium, Mitigation: Decouple the AI service via a message queue (Redis/BullMQ). Ensure the trading terminal works even if sentiment data is stale or unavailable., Risk: AI Service Latency affecting Trading UI. Impact: High, Mitigation: Implement Application-Level Encryption (AES-256) before writing to DB. Rotate Master Keys periodically., Risk: API Key Leakage via DB Dump. Summary: The QA strategy prioritizes the security of user assets (API keys) and the latency of the trading terminal. By leveraging Testcontainers for integration testing and Playwright for E2E
