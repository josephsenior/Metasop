This requires a vertical update across the project artifacts: defining the requirements (PM), designing the interface and data structures (Architect), and planning the execution (Engineer). Specifically, new user stories are needed to define the scope. The Architecture must be updated to include APIs for exporting files and managing workspace invitations, as well as database tables to support the new 'Workspace' entity.

\"design_doc\": \"## System Architecture Overview\\n\\nThis document outlines the architecture for a secure, PCI-DSS compliant e-commerce platform designed for high-volume retail with strict financial reporting requirements (SOX). The system adopts a **Layered Architecture** pattern with a clear separation of concerns between the presentation, application, domain, and infrastructure layers.\\n\\n### Core Components\\n\\n1.  **Frontend (SPA)**: Built with React, utilizing Redux for state management (specifically for the shopping cart and user session). It communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs over HTTPS.\\n2.  **Backend API (Node.js/Express)**: A stateless REST API serving as the entry point. It handles authentication, request validation, business logic execution, and orchestration of payment flows. It implements the **Controller-Service-Repository** pattern to decouple business logic from data access.\\n3.  **Database (PostgreSQL)**: The source of truth for all transactional data (users, orders, inventory). It enforces strict referential integrity and ACID compliance.\\n4.  **Caching Layer (Redis)**: Used for two primary purposes: high-speed session/cart management (ephemeral data) and caching frequently accessed product catalog queries to offload the primary database.\\n5.  **Payment Gateway (Stripe)**: Integrated via Stripe Elements on the frontend and Stripe SDK on the backend to ensure raw card data never touches our infrastructure (SAQ A-EP compliance).\\n\\n### Key Architectural Patterns\\n\\n*   **Token-Based Authentication**: Uses short-lived JWTs (15 min) and secure HTTP-only refresh tokens to balance security and UX.\\n*   **Event-Driven Audit Logging**: Critical for SOX compliance. Financial events (payment success, refund, inventory adjustment) trigger asynchronous writes to an immutable `audit_logs` table. This is decoupled from the main request path to ensure performance but guaranteed via transaction boundaries.\\n*   **Optimistic Concurrency Control**: Used for inventory management. When a user checks out, the system verifies the version/timestamp of the stock level to prevent overselling during concurrent high-traffic periods.\\n\\n### Data Flow & Security\\n\\n*   **PII Protection**: Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as names and addresses are encrypted at the application layer before insertion into PostgreSQL using AES-256-GCM.\\n*   **Payment Flow**: The frontend obtains a PaymentMethod ID from Stripe. The backend uses this ID to create a PaymentIntent. Webhooks from Stripe confirm the transaction status asynchronously, updating the order state from 'Pending' to 'Paid'.\\n\\n### Infrastructure\\n\\nThe application is containerized (Docker) for consistent deployment.

Project Setup & Architecture\\nThis project utilizes a **Monorepo** structure managed by Turborepo to ensure type safety across the full stack. The architecture separates concerns into `apps/web` (React SPA), `apps/api` (Express REST API), and shared packages for database (Prisma) and TypeScript definitions.\\n\\n### Development Workflow\\n- **Package Manager**: pnpm for efficient workspace management.\\n- **Version Control**: Conventional Commits enforced via Husky.\\n- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for linting, testing, and security scanning (SonarQube).\\n- **Local Env**: Docker Compose manages PostgreSQL and Redis instances.\\n\\n## 2. Coding Conventions\\n- **Backend**: Adhere to the Controller-Service-Repository pattern. All business logic resides in Services. Controllers handle HTTP parsing only.\\n- **Frontend**: Functional components with Hooks. Logic extracted to custom hooks (`useCart`, `useAuth`).\\n- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript configuration. No `any`. Shared DTOs defined in `packages/shared-types`.\\n- **Security**: \\n  - All PII encrypted at rest using AES-256.\\n  - Input validation using Zod on both client and server.\\n  - SQL injection prevention via Prisma ORM.\\n\\n## 3. Key Implementation Details\\n\\n### Authentication & Security\\n- **JWT Strategy**: Short-lived Access Tokens (15m) and HTTP-Only Refresh Tokens (7d).\\n- **Rate Limiting**: Redis-backed rate limiter on all public endpoints.\\n- **Audit Logging**: Asynchronous event bus triggers writes to the `audit_logs` table for every financial transaction (Payment, Refund, Inventory Adjustment).\\n\\n### Payment Processing (PCI-DSS)\\n- **Stripe Elements**: Used on the frontend to securely tokenize card data. Raw card numbers never touch our servers.\\n- **Webhooks**: Stripe webhooks are verified using the signing secret and handled idempotently to update order status.\\n\\n### State Management\\n- **Server State**: React Query for caching product data and search results.\\n- **Client State**: Redux Toolkit for managing the Shopping Cart and User Session.\\n\\n## 4. Testing Strategy\\n- **Unit Tests**: Jest for backend services and utility functions.\\n- **Integration Tests**: Supertest for API endpoints (mocking Stripe/Redis).\\n- **E2E Tests**: Cypress for critical user flows (Checkout, Login).\\n- **Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage required for merge.\",\n    \"implementation_plan_phases\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Phase 1: Foundation & Security\",\n        \"description\": \"Setup monorepo, database schema, and secure authentication system.\",\n        \"tasks\": [\n          \"Initialize Turborepo and Docker Compose\",\n          \"Design Prisma schema (Users, Products, AuditLogs)\",\n          \"Implement JWT Auth with Passport.js\",\n          \"Setup Redis connection and Rate Limiting middleware\"\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Phase 2: Product & Cart\",\n        \"description\": \"Core shopping functionality including catalog search and persistent cart.\",\n        \"tasks\": [\n          \"Build Product Catalog API with Pagination\",\n          \"Implement Redis-backed Shopping Cart Service\",\n          \"Create React Product Grid and Search components\",\n          \"Integrate Redux Toolkit for Cart state\"\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Phase 3: Checkout & Compliance\",\n        \"description\": \"Stripe integration and financial audit logging.\",\n        \"tasks\": [\n          \"Integrate Stripe PaymentIntents API\",\n          \"Implement Audit Log Service (Write-Only)\",\n          \"Build Secure Checkout UI with Stripe Elements\",\n          \"Setup Stripe Webhook handlers for order finalization\"\n        ]\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Phase 4: Production Readiness\",\n        \"description\": \"Optimization, security hardening, and deployment.\",\n        \"tasks\": [\n          \"Conduct Load Testing with k6\",\n          \"Configure Helmet CSP and Security Headers\",\n          \"Setup CI/CD pipelines for AWS ECS\",\n          \"Finalize API Documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)\"\n        ]\n      }\n    ],\n    \"state_management\": {\n      \"tool\": \"Redux Toolkit + React Query\",\n      \"strategy\": \"Redux for client-side session/cart state;
